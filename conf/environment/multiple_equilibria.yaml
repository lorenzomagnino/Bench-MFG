# Two-Beach Bar Coordination MFG (Multiple Equilibria Game)
#
# Reward: r(x,a,μ) = -c₁|a| - c₂ min{|x-x_L|, |x-x_R|} + α μ(x)
# where:
#   - c₁ = movement_penalty (penalizes motion)
#   - c₂ = beta (attraction to beach bars)
#   - α = alpha (positive mean-field interaction, favors crowded states)
#   - x_L, x_R = targets (symmetric target locations)
#
# For α >> c₂ >> c₁, the model admits exactly two stationary mean field
# Nash equilibria, with population fully concentrated at one of the two bars.
