# @package environment
# SIS Epidemic Model - Dynamics-Coupled Mean Field Game configuration
#
# This is a Dynamics-Coupled MFG where transitions depend on the population
# distribution μ, while rewards are decoupled from μ.
#
# State space: {0: Susceptible (S), 1: Infected (I)}
# Action space: Discretized social interaction intensity [0, 1]
# Dynamics: p(I|S, a, μ) = β · a · μ(I), recovery I→S with probability ν
# Reward: r(x, a) = a - C · I(x = I)
