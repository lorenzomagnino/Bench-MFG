# This is a non-potential MFG with a skew-symmetric interaction matrix.
# The Nash equilibrium is μ* = [1/3, 1/3, 1/3]ᵀ
#
# State space: {0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors}
# Action space: {0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors}
# The transition is deterministic: next_state = action

# Reward parameters
# The reward function is g(x, μ) = [Aμ]x where A is the skew-symmetric interaction matrix
