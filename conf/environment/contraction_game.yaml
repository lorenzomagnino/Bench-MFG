# @package environment
# Contraction Game environment configuration
#
# A 2-state, 2-action deterministic MFG where:
# - State space: {0, 1}
# - Action space: {Stay, Switch}
# - Dynamics: x_{n+1} = x_n if Stay, x_{n+1} = 1-x_n if Switch
# - Reward: r(x, a, μ) = -C · I(a=Switch) - α μ(x)
#
# If C > α/(1-γ), the best response is unique and constant (always Stay),
# making the fixed-point operator a contraction.
